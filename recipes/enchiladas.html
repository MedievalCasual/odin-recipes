    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p> <ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by dicing the onion up into 1/4 in. pieces.</li>
            <li>Chop the poatoes into tiny squares, about 1/8 in.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a large deep frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and cover, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes begin to turn transluscent, add the onion.</li>
            <li>Now add the beef and taco seasoning.</li>
            <li>Stir and cook.</li>
            <li>While cooking, cut up the pickles into pieces similar in size to the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Add the pickles about halfway through the beef cook.</li>
            <li>Cook until there is only a little moisture left.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl add the enchilada sauce.</li>
            <li>Dip a tortila into the enchilada sauce, liberally soaking both sides.</li>
            <li>Now, on a separate plate, add a scoop or two of the beef an roll. Be sure to tuck the ends in after the first fold.</li>
            <li>Fit the enchiladas into an oiled baking tray. It's okay if they are touching and squeezed in a bit.</li>
            <li>Cover with more sauce and top with shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook in oven on 400 for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and enchiladas are throughly heated.</li>
